# Convergence
A Game of Cooperative Word Alchemy. 


## Playing the Game
Prior to gameplay, our AI selects a word from the most common nouns in the English language. At the beginning of the game, the user will also get to choose a starting word. Once these words are revealed, the objective is to guess the same word as the AI. How might one accomplish such a challenging task? 

The key is to try to meet halfway by guessing words that have some semantic relationship to previously guessed words. For example, if one chooses 'lava' as a first word, and the AI selects 'water', then 'liquid', 'caldera', and 'steam' might be good guesses. Each game has maximum of 20 chances to converge on the same word.
